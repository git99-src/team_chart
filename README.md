## Installation
      
This application created using VS code, Node JS v12, Inquirer JS npm, Jest js npm and FS writeFile. Once Node JS is installed, you will need to run the "npm install" from the terminal.  It will use the package.json included to install Inquirer, jest and dependencies.
     

## Usage 
      
From the terminal command line in VS Code, the user can run the command - node app.js.  This CLI application will then prompt the user for employee information based on the team member type they wish to add - Manager, Engineer or Intern.  The application will then use the answers to the prompts to dynamically build a web page with the Team and their information.  The team.html page will be created in the root "output" folder which will also be created if it does not exist.
